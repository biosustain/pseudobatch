	abstract = {A pervasive issue in stable isotope tracing and metabolic flux analysis is the presence of naturally occurring isotopes such as 13C. For mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) measured by mass spectrometry, it is common practice to correct for natural occurrence of isotopes within metabolites of interest using a linear transform based on binomial distributions. The resulting corrected MIDs are often used to fit metabolic network models and infer metabolic fluxes, which implicitly assumes that corrected MIDs will yield the same flux solution as the actual observed MIDs. Although this assumption can be empirically verified in special cases by simulation studies, there seems to be no published proof of this important property for the general case. In this paper, we prove that this property holds for the case of noise-free MID data obtained at steady state. On the other hand, for noisy MID data, the flux solution will generally differ between the two representations. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the common practice of MID correction in metabolic flux analysis.},

Reflecting these recent developments, this textbook explains how such quantitative and computable genotype-phenotype relationships are built using a genome-wide basis of information about the gene portfolio of a target organism. It describes how biological knowledge is assembled to reconstruct biochemical reaction networks, the formulation of computational models of biological functions, and how these models can be used to address key biological questions and enable predictive biology.

This approach allows the direct assessment of mass isotopomer distributions of primary metabolites. The method is applied to the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7D grown in an aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture. Detailed investigations of the measured mass isotopomer distributions demonstrate the accuracy and information-richness of the obtained data. The mass fractions are ﬁtted with a cumomer model to yield the metabolic ﬂuxes. It is estimated that 24\% of the consumed glucose is catabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, it is found that turnover of storage carbohydrates occurs. Inclusion of this turnover in the model leads to a large conﬁdence interval of the estimated split ratio.},

	abstract = {High-throughput experimentation has revolutionized data-driven experimental sciences and opened the door to the application of machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the quality of any data analysis strongly depends on the quality of the data and specifically the degree to which random effects in the experimental data-generating process are quantified and accounted for. Accordingly calibration, i.e. the quantitative association between observed quantities and measurement responses, is a core element of many workflows in experimental sciences. Particularly in life sciences, univariate calibration, often involving non-linear saturation effects, must be performed to extract quantitative information from measured data. At the same time, the estimation of uncertainty is inseparably connected to quantitative experimentation. Adequate calibration models that describe not only the input/output relationship in a measurement system but also its inherent measurement noise are required. Due to its mathematical nature, statistically robust calibration modeling remains a challenge for many practitioners, at the same time being extremely beneficial for machine learning applications. In this work, we present a bottom-up conceptual and computational approach that solves many problems of understanding and implementing non-linear, empirical calibration modeling for quantification of analytes and process modeling. The methodology is first applied to the optical measurement of biomass concentrations in a high-throughput cultivation system, then to the quantification of glucose by an automated enzymatic assay. We implemented the conceptual framework in two Python packages, calibr8 and murefi, with which we demonstrate how to make uncertainty quantification for various calibration tasks more accessible. Our software packages enable more reproducible and automatable data analysis routines compared to commonly observed workflows in life sciences. Subsequently, we combine the previously established calibration models with a hierarchical Monod-like ordinary differential equation model of microbial growth to describe multiple replicates of Corynebacterium glutamicum batch cultures. Key process model parameters are learned by both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, highlighting the flexibility of the statistical and computational framework.},

              S. cerevisiae
              by culturing the strain with a wide range of specific growth rates using glucose as the sole limiting nutrient. Under these different conditions, we measure the absolute transcriptome, the absolute proteome, the phosphoproteome, and the metabolome. Most functional protein groups show a linear dependence on the specific growth rate. Proteins engaged in translation show a perfect linear increase with the specific growth rate, while glycolysis and chaperone proteins show a linear decrease under respiratory conditions. Glycolytic enzymes and chaperones, however, show decreased phosphorylation with increasing specific growth rates; at the same time, an overall increased flux through these pathways is observed. Further analysis show that even though mRNA levels do not correlate with protein levels for all individual genes, the transcriptome level of functional groups correlates very well with its corresponding proteome. Finally, using enzyme-constrained genome-scale modeling, we find that enzyme usage plays an important role in controlling flux in amino acid biosynthesis.},

              Metal ions are essential to all living cells, as they can serve as cofactors of enzymes to drive catalysis of biochemical reactions. We present a constraint-based model of yeast that relates metabolism with metal ions via enzymes. The model is able to capture responses of metabolism and gene expression upon iron depletion, suggesting that yeast cells allocate iron resource in the way abiding to optimization principles. Interestingly, the model predicts up-regulation of several iron-containing enzymes that coincide with experiments, which raises the possibility that the decrease in activity due to limited iron could be compensated by elevated enzyme abundance. Moreover, the model paves the way for guiding biosynthesis of high-value compounds (e.g.,
              p
              -coumaric acid) that relies on iron-containing enzymes.
            
          , 
            
              Metal ions are vital to metabolism, as they can act as cofactors on enzymes and thus modulate individual enzymatic reactions. Although many enzymes have been reported to interact with metal ions, the quantitative relationships between metal ions and metabolism are lacking. Here, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              to account for proteome constraints and enzyme cofactors such as metal ions, named CofactorYeast. The model is able to estimate abundances of metal ions binding on enzymes in cells under various conditions, which are comparable to measured metal ion contents in biomass. In addition, the model predicts distinct metabolic flux distributions in response to reduced levels of various metal ions in the medium. Specifically, the model reproduces changes upon iron deficiency in metabolic and gene expression levels, which could be interpreted by optimization principles (i.e., yeast optimizes iron utilization based on metabolic network and enzyme kinetics rather than preferentially targeting iron to specific enzymes or pathways). At last, we show the potential of using the model for understanding cell factories that harbor heterologous iron-containing enzymes to synthesize high-value compounds such as
              p
              -coumaric acid. Overall, the model demonstrates the dependence of enzymes on metal ions and links metal ions to metabolism on a genome scale.},

Heart rate, blood pressure, and urinary catecholamine changes for Tai Chi were found to be similar to those for walking at a speed of 6 km/hr.

An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%–40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A was grown in glucose-limited chemostat culture with 0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, 2.8\% or 20.9\% O2 in the inlet gas (D = 0.10 hÀ1, pH 5, 30 1C) to determine the effects of oxygen on 17 metabolites and 69 genes related to central carbon metabolism. The concentrations of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites and all glycolytic metabolites except 2-phosphoglycerate1 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate were higher in anaerobic than in fully aerobic conditions. Provision of only 0.5–1\% O2 reduced the concentrations of most metabolites, as compared with anaerobic conditions. Transcription of most genes analyzed was reduced in 0\%, 0.5\% or 1.0\% O2 relative to cells grown in 2.8\% or 20.9\% O2. Ethanol production was observed with 2.8\% or less O2. After steady-state analysis in deﬁned oxygen concentrations, the conditions were switched from aerobic to anaerobic. Metabolite and transcript levels were monitored for up to 96 h after the transition, and this showed that more than 30 h was required for the cells to fully adapt to anaerobiosis. Levels of metabolites of upper glycolysis and the TCA cycle increased following the transition to anaerobic conditions, whereas those of metabolites of lower glycolysis generally decreased. Gene regulation was more complex, with some genes showing transient upregulation or downregulation during the adaptation to anaerobic conditions.},

Even though microbial production of various chemicals has successfully been conducted and commercialized, there are still numerous chemicals and materials that await their efficient bio-based production. Aromatic chemicals, which are typically derived from benzene, toluene and xylene in petroleum industry, have been used in large amounts in various industries. Over the last three decades, many metabolically engineered microorganisms have been developed for the bio-based production of aromatic chemicals, many of which are derived from aromatic amino acid pathways. This review highlights the latest metabolic engineering strategies and tools applied to the biosynthesis of aromatic chemicals, many derived from shikimate and aromatic amino acids, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine and l-tryptophan. It is expected that more and more engineered microorganisms capable of efficiently producing aromatic chemicals will be developed toward their industrial-scale production from renewable biomass.},

	abstract = {Background: A reliable quenching and metabolite extraction method has been developed for Lactobacillus plantarum. The energy charge value was used as a critical indicator for fixation of metabolism.
Results: Four different aqueous quenching solutions, all containing 60\% of methanol, were compared for their efficiency. Only the solutions containing either 70 mM HEPES or 0.85\% (w/v) ammonium carbonate (pH 5.5) caused less than 10\% cell leakage and the energy charge of the quenched cells was high, indicating rapid inactivation of the metabolism. The efficiency of extraction of intracellular metabolites from cell cultures depends on the extraction methods, and is expected to vary between micro-organisms. For L. plantarum, we have compared five different extraction methodologies based on (i) cold methanol, (ii) perchloric acid, (iii) boiling ethanol, (iv) chloroform/methanol (1:1) and (v) chloroform/water (1:1). Quantification of representative intracellular metabolites showed that the best extraction efficiencies were achieved with cold methanol, boiling ethanol and perchloric acid.
Conclusion: The ammonium carbonate solution was selected as the most suitable quenching buffer for metabolomics studies in L. plantarum because (i) leakage is minimal, (ii) the energy charge indicates good fixation of metabolism, and (iii) all components are easily removed during freezedrying. A modified procedure based on cold methanol extraction combined good extractability with mild extraction conditions and high enzymatic inactivation. These features make the combination of these quenching and extraction protocols very suitable for metabolomics studies with L. plantarum.},

The workflow comprises a custom-built platform for automated cultivation and sampling of microbes, sample preparation protocols, analytical methods for sample analysis and automated scripts for raw data processing.

	abstract = {Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization. In this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbe’s metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains. We demonstrate the method’s capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of Escherichia coli, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an in vivo cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the method’s performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library. Overall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.},

	abstract = {The study of plant-environment interactions is a multidisciplinary research field. With the emergence of quantitative large-scale and high-throughput techniques, amount and dimensionality of experimental data have strongly increased. Appropriate strategies for data storage, management, and evaluation are needed to make efficient use of experimental findings. Computational approaches of data mining are essential for deriving statistical trends and signatures contained in data matrices. Although, current biology is challenged by high data dimensionality in general, this is particularly true for plant biology. Plants as sessile organisms have to cope with environmental fluctuations. This typically results in strong dynamics of metabolite and protein concentrations which are often challenging to quantify. Summarizing experimental output results in complex data arrays, which need computational statistics and numerical methods for building quantitative models. Experimental findings need to be combined by computational models to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant metabolism. For this, bioinformatics and mathematics need to be combined with experimental setups in physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This review presents and discusses concepts at the interface of experiment and computation, which are likely to shape current and future plant biology. Finally, this interface is discussed with regard to its capabilities and limitations to develop a quantitative model of plant-environment interactions.},

In the era of Big Data, IoT, and Industry 4.0, EDM becomes an even more important task in the context of Digitalization. This paper describes a meta-model-based approach that lets the data scientist map elements of different data models to elements of an enterprise data model using UML class diagrams, the UML Profile mechanism, OCL, and model transformations. This leads to an executable data mapper for Enterprise data management that transfers and consolidated data from operational information systems into an enterprise database.},

Compared to the conventional off-line biomass determination, the capacitance value exhibited a completely consistent trend with colony forming units, indicating that the capacitance value could reflect the living cells in the fermentation broth. On the other hand, in comparison to the results of off-line determination by high-performance liquid chromatography, the ethanol concentration measured by electronic nose presented an excellent consistency, so as to realize the on-line monitoring during the whole process. On this basis, a dynamic feeding strategy of glucose guided by the changes of living cells and ethanol content was developed. And consequently, the ethanol concentration, productivity and yield were enhanced by 15.4\%, 15.9\% and 9.0\%, respectively. The advanced sensors adopted herein to monitor the key parameters of ethanol fermentation process could be readily extended to an industrial scale and other similar fermentation processes.},

	abstract = {Science revolves around the best way of conducting an experiment to obtain insightful results. Experiments with maximal information content can be found by computational experimental design (ED) strategies that identify optimal conditions under which to perform the experiment. Several criteria have been proposed to measure the information content, each emphasizing different aspects of the design goal, i.e., reduction of uncertainty. Where experiments are complex or expensive, second sight is at the budget governing the achievable amount of information. In this context, the design objectives cost and information gain are often incommensurable, though dependent. By casting the ED task into a multiple-criteria optimization problem, a set of trade-off designs is derived that approximates the Paretofrontier which is instrumental for exploring preferable designs. In this work, we present a computational methodology for multiple-criteria ED of information-rich experiments that accounts for virtually any set of design criteria. The methodology is implemented for the case of 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA), which is arguably the most expensive type among the ‘omics’ technologies, featuring dozens of design parameters (tracer composition, analytical platform, measurement selection etc.). Supported by an innovative visualization scheme, we demonstrate with two realistic showcases that the use of multiple criteria reveals deep insights into the conflicting interplay between information carriers and cost factors that are not amendable to single-objective ED. For instance, tandem mass spectrometry turns out as best-in-class with respect to information gain, while it delivers this information quality cheaper than the other, routinely applied analytical technologies. Therewith, our Pareto approach to ED offers the investigator great flexibilities in the conception phase of a study to balance costs and benefits.},

	abstract = {A soft sensor approach is described for controlling metabolic overﬂow from mixed-acid fermentation and glucose overﬂow metabolism in a fed-batch cultivation for production of recombinant green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP) in Escherichia coli. The hardware part of the sensor consisted of a near-infrared in situ probe that monitored the E. coli biomass and an HPLC analyzer equipped with a ﬁltration unit that measured the overﬂow metabolites. The computational part of the soft sensor used basic kinetic equations and summations for estimation of speciﬁc rates and total metabolite concentrations. Two control strategies for media feeding of the fed-batch cultivation were evaluated: (1) controlling the speciﬁc rates of overﬂow metabolism and mixed-acid fermentation metabolites at a ﬁxed pre-set target values, and (2) controlling the concentration of the sum of these metabolites at a set level. The results indicate that the latter strategy was more efﬁcient for maintaining a high titer and low variability of the produced recombinant GFP protein.},

              The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production. However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding metabolic engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a

              p
              -coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two pathways. This results in a maximum

However, the ethanol productivities achieved on xylose are still significantly lower than those observed on glucose for reasons that are not well understood. We have undertaken an analysis of central carbon metabolite pool sizes and metabolic fluxes on glucose and on xylose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in a strain capable of rapid xylose assimilation via xylose isomerase in order to investigate factors that may limit the rate of xylose fermentation. We find that during xylose utilization the flux through the non-oxidative PPP is high but the flux through the oxidative PPP is low, highlighting an advantage of the strain employed in this study. Furthermore, xylose fails to elicit the full carbon catabolite repression response that is characteristic of glucose fermentation in S. cerevisiae. We present indirect evidence that the incomplete activation of the fermentation program on xylose results in a bottleneck in lower glycolysis, leading to inefficient re-oxidation of NADH produced in glycolysis.},

Here, we used flux-based modeling approaches to improve yields of fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We combined 13C labeling data with comprehensive genome-scale models to shed light onto microbial metabolism and improve metabolic engineering efforts. We concentrated on studying the balance of acetyl-CoA, a precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. A genomewide acetyl-CoA balance study showed ATP citrate lyase from Yarrowia lipolytica as a robust source of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA and malate synthase as a desirable target for downregulation in terms of acetyl-CoA consumption. These genetic modifications were applied to S. cerevisiae WRY2, a strain that is capable of producing 460 mg/L of free fatty acids. With the addition of ATP citrate lyase and downregulation of malate synthase, the engineered strain produced 26\% more free fatty acids. Further increases in free fatty acid production of 33\% were obtained by knocking out the cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which flux analysis had shown was competing for carbon flux upstream with the carbon flux through the acetyl-CoA production pathway in the cytoplasm. In total, the genetic interventions applied in this work increased fatty acid production by {\textasciitilde}70\%.},

This review aims to establish the necessary guidelines for performing 13C-MFA at the genome-scale for a compartmentalized eukaryotic system such as yeast in terms of model and data requirements, while addressing key issues such as statistical analysis and network complexity. We describe the various approaches used to simplify the genome-scale model in the absence of sufficient experimental flux measurements, the availability and generation of reaction atom mapping information, and the experimental flux and metabolite labeling distribution measurements to ensure statistical validity of the obtained flux distribution. Organism-specific challenges such as the impact of compartmentalization of metabolism, variability of biomass composition, and the cell-cycle dependence of metabolism are discussed. Identification of errors arising from incorrect gene annotation and suggested alternate routes using MFA are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) and associated techniques operating on stoichiometric genome-scale metabolic models play a central role in quantifying metabolic flows and constraining feasible phenotypes. At the heart of these methods lie two important assumptions: (i) the biomass precursors and energy requirements neither change in response to growth conditions nor environmental/genetic perturbations, and (ii) metabolite production and consumption rates are equal at all times (i.e., steady-state). Despite the stringency of these two assumptions, FBA has been shown to be surprisingly robust at predicting cellular phenotypes. In this paper, we formally assess the impact of these two assumptions on FBA results by quantifying how uncertainty in biomass reaction coefficients, and departures from steady-state due to temporal fluctuations could propagate to FBA results. In the first case, conditional sampling of parameter space is required to re-weigh the biomass reaction so as the molecular weight remains equal to 1 g mmol− 1, and in the second case, metabolite (and elemental) pool conservation must be imposed under temporally varying conditions. Results confirm the importance of enforcing the aforementioned constraints and explain the robustness of FBA biomass yield predictions.},

This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets.

	abstract = {The use of parallel labeling experiments for 13C metabolic ﬂux analysis (13C-MFA) has emerged in recent years as the new gold standard in ﬂuxomics. The methodology has been termed COMPLETE-MFA, short for complementary parallel labeling experiments technique for metabolic ﬂux analysis. In this contribution, we have tested the limits of COMPLETE-MFA by demonstrating integrated analysis of 14 parallel labeling experiments with Escherichia coli. An effort on such a massive scale has never been attempted before. In addition to several widely used isotopic tracers such as [1,2-13C]glucose and mixtures of [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose, four novel tracers were applied in this study: [2,3-13C]glucose, [4,5,6-13C]glucose, [2,3,4,5,6-13C]glucose and a mixture of [1-13C]glucose and [4,5,6-13C]glucose. This allowed us for the ﬁrst time to compare the performance of a large number of isotopic tracers. Overall, there was no single best tracer for the entire E. coli metabolic network model. Tracers that produced well-resolved ﬂuxes in the upper part of metabolism (glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways) showed poor performance for ﬂuxes in the lower part of metabolism (TCA cycle and anaplerotic reactions), and vice versa. The best tracer for upper metabolism was 80\% [1-13C]glucoseþ20\% [U-13C]glucose, while [4,5,6-13C]glucose and [5-13C] glucose both produced optimal ﬂux resolution in the lower part of metabolism. COMPLETE-MFA improved both ﬂux precision and ﬂux observability, i.e. more independent ﬂuxes were resolved with smaller conﬁdence intervals, especially exchange ﬂuxes. Overall, this study demonstrates that COMPLETE-MFA is a powerful approach for improving ﬂux measurements and that this methodology should be considered in future studies that require very high ﬂux resolution.},

It was found that the ﬂuxes of consumed (O2, glucose/ethanol) and secreted compounds (CO2) did not change signiﬁcantly during the entire cultivation period. However, morphological changes were observed, leading to an increased cellular surface area. During 90 generations of chemostat growth not only the residual glucose concentration decreased, also the intracellular concentrations of trehalose, glycolytic intermediates, TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids were found to have decreased with a factor 5–10. The only exception was glyoxylate which showed a ﬁvefold increase in concentration. In addition to this the speciﬁc activities of most glycolytic enzymes also decreased by a factor 5–10 during long-term cultivation. Exceptions to this were hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of which the activities remained unchanged. Furthermore, the concentrations of the adenylate nucleotides as well as the energy charge of the cells did not change in a signiﬁcant manner. Surprisingly, the speciﬁc activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malate synthase (MS) and isocitrate lyase (ICL) increased signiﬁcantly during 90 generations of chemostat cultivation. These changes seem to indicate a pattern where metabolic overcapacities (for reversible reactions) and storage pools (trehalose, high levels of amino acids and excess protein in enzymes) are lost during the evolution period. The driving force is proposed to be a growth advantage in the absence of these metabolic overcapacities.},

In contrast, quenching with cold isotonic saline (0.9\% [w/v] NaCl, 0.5 °C) did not damage cells and effectively halted conversion of ATP to ADP and AMP, indicative of metabolic arrest. Of the 12 different extraction methods tested, cold extraction in 50\% aqueous acetonitrile was superior to other methods. The recovery of a mixture of standards was excellent, and the concentration of extracted intracellular metabolites was higher than for the other methods tested. The ﬁnal protocol is easy to implement and can be used to study the intracellular metabolomes of mammalian cells.},

The compartmentation of eukaryotic cells adds to model complexity. Model constraints are ideally based on biochemical evidence, which is rarely available for non-conventional yeast and eukaryotic cells. A small-scale model for 13C-based metabolic ﬂux analysis of central yeast carbon metabolism was developed that is universally valid and does not depend on localization information regarding amino acid anabolism. The variable compartmental origin of traced metabolites is a feature that allows application of the model to yeasts with uncertain genomic and transcriptional backgrounds. The presented test case includes the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Highly similar ﬂux solutions were computed using either a model with undeﬁned pathway localization or a model with constraints based on curated (S. cerevisiae) or computationally predicted (H. polymorpha) localization information, while false solutions were found with incorrect localization constraints. These results indicate a potentially adverse eﬀect of universally assuming Saccharomyces-like constraints on amino acid biosynthesis for non-conventional yeasts and verify the validity of neglecting compartmentation constraints using a small-scale metabolic model. The model was speciﬁcally designed to investigate the intracellular metabolism of wild-type yeasts under various growth conditions but is also expected to be useful for computing ﬂuxes of other eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Fatty alcohols are widely used in various applications within a diverse set of industries, such as the soap and detergent industry, the personal care, and cosmetics industry, as well as the food industry. The total world production of fatty alcohols is over 2 million tons with approximately equal parts derived from fossil oil and from plant oils or animal fats. Due to the environmental impact of these production methods, there is an interest in alternative methods for fatty alcohol production via microbial fermentation using cheap renewable feedstocks. In this study, we aimed to obtain a better understanding of how fatty alcohol biosynthesis impacts the host organism, baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Producing and non-producing strains were compared in growth and nitrogen-depletion cultivation phases. The multi-omics analysis included physiological characterization, transcriptome analysis by RNAseq, 13Cmetabolic flux analysis, and intracellular metabolomics. Both species accumulated fatty alcohols under nitrogen-depletion conditions but not during growth. The fatty alcohol–producing Y. lipolytica strain had a higher fatty alcohol production rate than an analogous S. cerevisiae strain. Nitrogen-depletion phase was associated with lower glucose uptake rates and a decrease in the intracellular concentration of acetyl–CoA in both yeast species, as well as increased organic acid secretion rates in Y. lipolytica. Expression of the fatty alcohol–producing enzyme fatty acyl–CoA reductase alleviated the growth defect caused by deletion of hexadecenal dehydrogenase encoding genes (HFD1 and HFD4) in Y. lipolytica. RNAseq analysis showed that fatty alcohol production triggered a cell wall stress response in S. cerevisiae. RNAseq analysis also showed that both nitrogen-depletion and fatty alcohol production have substantial effects on the expression of transporter encoding genes in Y. lipolytica. In conclusion, through this multi-omics study, we uncovered some effects of fatty alcohol production on the host metabolism. This knowledge can be used as guidance for further strain improvement towards the production of fatty alcohols.},

Quenching in 60\% (v/v) methanol at -40°C is currently the standard method for sub-second arrest of metabolic activity in microbial metabolomics but there have been contradictory reports in the literature on whether leakage of metabolites from the cells occurs. We have re-evaluated this method in S. cerevisiae using a comprehensive, strictly quantitative approach. By determining the levels of a large range of metabolites in different sample fractions and establishing mass balances we could trace their fate during the quenching procedure and conﬁrm that leakage of metabolites from yeast cells does occur during conventional cold methanol quenching, to such an extent that the levels of most metabolites have been previously underestimated by at least twofold. In addition, we found that the extent of leakage depends on the time of exposure, the temperature and the properties of the methanol solutions. Using the mass balance approach we could study the effect of different quenching conditions and demonstrate that leakage can be entirely prevented by quenching in pure methanol at B-40°C, which we propose as a new improved method. Making use of improved data on intracellular metabolite levels we also re-evaluated the need of sub-second quenching of metabolic activity and of removing the extracellular medium. Our ﬁndings have serious implications for quantitative metabolomics-based ﬁelds such as non-stationary 13C ﬂux analysis, in vivo kinetic modeling and thermodynamic network analysis.},

To this end, metabolism is tightly controlled by dynamic and intricate regulatory mechanisms involving allostery, enzyme abundance and post-translational modiﬁcations. The study of the molecular entities involved in these complex mechanisms has been boosted by the advent of high-throughput technologies. The so-called omics enable the quantiﬁcation of the diﬀerent molecular entities at diﬀerent system layers, connecting the genotype with the phenotype. Therefore, the study of the overall behavior of a metabolic network and the omics data integration and analysis must be approached from a holistic perspective. Due to the close relationship between metabolism and cellular phenotype, metabolic modelling has emerged as a valuable tool to decipher the underlying mechanisms governing cell phenotype. Constraint-based modelling and kinetic modelling are among the most widely used methods to study cell metabolism at diﬀerent scales, ranging from cells to tissues and organisms. These approaches enable integrating metabolomic data, among others, to enhance model predictive capabilities. In this review, we describe the current state of the art in metabolic modelling and discuss future perspectives and current challenges in the ﬁeld.},

This basic set of controller motifs, which can be considered as complete, divides into two operational work modes, termed as inﬂow and outﬂow control.

The antagonistic character of hormonal control systems can be understood by a combination of inﬂow and outﬂow controllers.},

This framework systematically combines data preprocessing, elemental balancing and statistical analysis technique. Initially, specific rates of cell growth, glucose/amino acid consumptions and mAb/metabolite productions were calculated via curve fitting using logistic equations, with subsequent elemental balancing of the preprocessed data indicating the presence of experimental measurement errors. Multivariate statistical analysis was then employed to understand physiological characteristics of the cellular system. The results from principal component analysis (PCA) revealed three major clusters of amino acids with similar trends in their consumption profiles: (i) arginine, threonine and serine, (ii) glycine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, methionine, histidine and asparagine, and (iii) lysine, valine and isoleucine. Further analysis using partial least square (PLS) regression identified key amino acids which were positively or negatively correlated with the cell growth, mAb production and the generation of lactate and ammonia. Based on these results, the optimal concentrations of key amino acids in the feed medium can be inferred, potentially leading to an increase in cell viability and productivity, as well as a decrease in toxic waste production. The study demonstrated how the current methodological framework using multivariate statistical analysis techniques can serve as a potential tool for deriving rational medium design strategies.},

Linearized forms of the logistic growth, logistic decline, and generalized logistic equation were derived to obtain initial estimates of the parameters by linear least squares. These initial estimates facilitated subsequent determination of refined values by nonlinear optimization using three different algorithms. Data from BHK, CHO, and hybridoma cells in batch or fed-batch cultures at volumes ranging from 100 mL–300 L were tested with the above approach and solution convergence was obtained for all three nonlinear optimization approaches for all data sets. This result, despite the sensitivity of logistic equations to parameter variation because of their exponential nature, demonstrated that robust estimation of logistic parameters was possible by this combination of linearization followed by nonlinear optimization. The approach is relatively simple and can be implemented in a spreadsheet to robustly model mammalian cell culture batch or fed-batch data. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

One model was designed primarily with kinetic equations in the tradition of Michaelis and Menten whereas the other two models were designed as alternative power-law models within the framework of Biochemical Systems Theory. Each model contains about 50 variables, about a quarter of which are dependent (state) variables, while the others are independent inputs and enzyme activities that are considered constant. The models account for known regulatory signals that exert control over the pathway. Standard mathematical testing, repeated revisiting of the literature, and numerous rounds of amendments and refinements resulted in models that are stable and rather insensitive to perturbations in inputs or parameter values. The models also appear to be compatible with the modest amount of experimental experience that lends itself to direct comparisons. Even though the three models are based on different mathematical representations, they show dynamic responses to a variety of perturbations and changes in conditions that are essentially equivalent for small perturbations and similar for large perturbations. The kinetic information used for model construction and the models themselves can serve as a starting point for future analyses and refinements.},

	abstract = {In recent years, synthetic gene circuits for adding new cell features have become one of the most powerful tools in biological and pharmaceutical research and development. However, because of the inherent non-linearity and noisy experimental data, the experiment-based model calibration of these synthetic parts is perceived as a laborious and time-consuming procedure. Although the optimal experimental design (OED) based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) has been proved to be an effective means to improve the calibration efﬁciency, the required calculation increases dramatically with the model size (parameter number). To reduce the OED complexity without losing the calibration accuracy, this paper proposes two OED approaches with different parameter clustering methods and validates the accuracy of calibrated models with in-silico experiments. A model of an inducible synthetic promoter in S. cerevisiae is adopted for bench-marking. The comparison with the traditional off-line OED approach suggests that the OED approaches with both of the clustering methods signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of OED problems (for at least 49.0\%), while slightly improving the calibration accuracy (11.8\% and 19.6\% lower estimation error in average for FIM-based and sensitivity-based approaches). This study implicates that for calibrating non-linear models of biological pathways, cluster-based OED could be a beneﬁcial approach to improve the efﬁciency of optimal experimental design.},

              -coumaric acid, which are precursors of a wide range of aromatic compounds of biotechnological interest. Lack of highly active and specific tyrosine ammonia-lyases has previously been a limitation in metabolic engineering approaches. We therefore identified 22 sequences
              in silico
              using synteny information and aiming for sequence divergence. We performed a comparative
              in vivo
              study, expressing the genes intracellularly in bacteria and yeast. When produced heterologously, some enzymes resulted in significantly higher production of
              p
              -coumaric acid in several different industrially important production organisms. Three novel enzymes were found to have activity exclusively for phenylalanine, including an enzyme from the low-GC Gram-positive bacterium
              Brevibacillus laterosporus
              , a bacterial-type enzyme from the amoeba
              Dictyostelium discoideum
              , and a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from the moss
              Physcomitrella patens
              (producing 230 μM cinnamic acid per unit of optical density at 600 nm [OD
              600
              ]) in the medium using
              Escherichia coli
              as the heterologous host). Novel tyrosine ammonia-lyases having higher reported substrate specificity than previously characterized enzymes were also identified. Enzymes from
              Herpetosiphon aurantiacus
              and
              Flavobacterium johnsoniae
              resulted in high production of

              . The enzymes were also efficient in

              , where
              p
              -coumaric acid accumulation was improved 5-fold over that in strains expressing previously characterized tyrosine ammonia-lyases.},

	abstract = {Background:  A key focus of synthetic biology is to develop microbial or cell-free based biobased routes to valueadded chemicals such as fragrances. Originally, we developed the EcoFlex system, a Golden Gate toolkit, to study genes/pathways flexibly using Escherichia coli heterologous expression. In this current work, we sought to use EcoFlex to optimise a synthetic raspberry ketone biosynthetic pathway. Raspberry ketone is a high-value ({\textasciitilde} £20,000 ­kg−1) fine chemical farmed from raspberry (Rubeus rubrum) fruit.
Results:  By applying a synthetic biology led design-build-test-learn cycle approach, we refactor the raspberry ketone pathway from a low level of productivity (0.2 mg/L), to achieve a 65-fold (12.9 mg/L) improvement in production. We perform this optimisation at the prototype level (using microtiter plate cultures) with E. coli DH10β, as a routine cloning host. The use of E. coli DH10β facilitates the Golden Gate cloning process for the screening of combinatorial libraries. In addition, we also newly establish a novel colour-based phenotypic screen to identify productive clones quickly from solid/liquid culture.
Conclusions:  Our findings provide a stable raspberry ketone pathway that relies upon a natural feedstock (L-tyrosine) and uses only constitutive promoters to control gene expression. In conclusion we demonstrate the capability of EcoFlex for fine-tuning a model fine chemical pathway and provide a range of newly characterised promoter tools gene expression in E. coli.},

Here we demonstrate the de novo production of noscapine in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              , through the reconstruction of a biosynthetic pathway comprising over 30 enzymes from plants, bacteria, mammals, and yeast itself, including 7 plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized enzymes. Optimization directed to tuning expression of pathway enzymes, host endogenous metabolic pathways, and fermentation conditions led to an over 18,000-fold improvement from initial noscapine titers to ∼2.2 mg/L. By feeding modified tyrosine derivatives to the optimized noscapine-producing strain we further demonstrated microbial production of halogenated benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This work highlights the potential for microbial biosynthetic platforms to support the synthesis of valuable and novel alkaloid compounds, which can advance alkaloid-based drug discovery and development.},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks the ability to ferment the pentose sugar xylose that is the second most abundant sugar in nature. Therefore two different xylose catabolic pathways have been heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae. Whereas the xylose reductase (XR)-xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) pathway leads to the production of the by-product xylitol, the xylose isomerase (XI) pathway results in signiﬁcantly lower xylose consumption. In this study, kinetic models including the reactions ranging from xylose transport into the cell to the phosphorylation of xylulose to xylulose 5-P were constructed. They were used as prediction tools for the identiﬁcation of putative targets for the improvement of xylose utilization in S. cerevisiae strains engineered for higher level of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes, higher xylulokinase and inactivated GRE3 gene encoding an endogenous NADPH-dependent aldose reductase. For both pathways, the in silico analyses identiﬁed a need for even higher xylulokinase (XK) activity. In a XR-XDH strain expressing an integrated copy of the Escherichia coli XK encoding gene xylB about a six-fold reduction of xylitol formation was conﬁrmed under anaerobic conditions. Similarly overexpression of the xylB gene in a XI strain increased the aerobic growth rate on xylose by 21\%. In contrast to the in silico predictions, the aerobic growth also increased 24\% when the xylose transporter gene GXF1 from Candida intermedia was overexpressed together with xylB in the XI strain. Under anaerobic conditions, the XI strains overexpressing xylB gene and the combination of xylB and GFX1 genes consumed 27\% and 37\% more xylose than the control strain.},

	abstract = {The L-tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis pathway is highly regulated at multiple levels. The three types of regulations identiﬁed so far, namely repression, attenuation, and feedback inhibition have greatly impacted our understanding and engineering of cellular metabolism. In this study, feed-forward regulation is discovered as a novel regulation of this pathway and explored for engineering Escherichia coli for more eﬃcient Trp biosynthesis. Speciﬁcally, indole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) of the multifunctional enzyme TrpC from E. coli is found to be feed-forward inhibited by anthranilate noncompetitively. Surprisingly, IGPS of TrpC from both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger was found to be feed-forward activated, for which the glutamine aminotransferase domain is essential. The anthranilate binding site of IGPS from E. coli is identiﬁed and mutated, resulting in more tolerant variants for improved Trp biosynthesis. Furthermore, expressing the anthranilateactivated TrpC from A. niger in a previously engineered Trp producing E. coli strain S028 made the strain more robust in growth and more eﬃcient in Trp production in bioreactor. It not only increased the Trp concentration from 19 to 29 g/L within 42 h, but also improved the maximum Trp yield from 0.15 to 0.18 g/g in simple fedbatch fermentations, setting a new level to rationally designed Trp producing strains. The ﬁndings are of fundamental interest for understanding and re-designing dynamics and control of metabolic pathways in general and provide a novel target and solution to engineering of E. coli for eﬃcient Trp production particularly.},

	abstract = {Most cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis and increased glucose uptake for the production of biosynthetic precursors needed to support rapid proliferation. Increased glucose uptake and glycolytic activity may result in intracellular acidosis and increase of osmotically active substances, leading to cell swelling. This causes dilution of cellular constituents, which can markedly inﬂuence cellular reactions and the function of proteins, and hence, control mechanisms used by cancer cells to maintain a highly glycolytic phenotype must be robust to dilution. In this paper, we review the literature on cancer cell metabolism and glucose uptake, and employ mathematical modeling to examine control mechanisms in cancer cell metabolism that show robust homeostatic control in the presence of dilution. Using diﬀerential gene expression data from the Expression Atlas database, we identify the key components of glucose uptake in cancer, in order to guide the construction of a mathematical model. By simulations of this model we show that while negative feedback from downstream glycolytic metabolites to glucose transporters is suﬃcient for homeostatic control of glycolysis in a constant cellular volume, it is necessary to control intermediate glycolytic enzymes in order to achieve homeostatic control during growth. With a focus on glucose uptake in cancer, we demonstrate a systems biology approach to the identiﬁcation, reduction, and analysis of complex regulatory systems.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of molecular-level changes within central metabolism allow a cell to adapt to the changing environment. A primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here, we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses multiple steady-state observations of 13C-resolved ﬂuxes, metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions. Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and identiﬁes an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription mainly regulating TCA cycle ﬂux and reactants regulating EMP pathway ﬂux. We verify these observations using time-resolved measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming, hypothesisdriven molecular validations.},

The Y. lipolytica strain expressing a heterologous pathway produced 52.1 ± 1.2 mg/L resveratrol in a small-scale cultivation. The titer increased to 409.0 ± 1.2 mg/L when the strain was further engineered with feedbackinsensitive alleles of the key genes in the shikimate pathway and with five additional copies of the heterolo­ gous biosynthetic genes. In controlled fed-batch bioreactor, the strain produced 12.4 ± 0.3 g/L resveratrol, the highest reported titer to date for de novo resveratrol production, with a yield on glucose of 54.4 ± 1.6 mg/g and a productivity of 0.14 ± 0.01 g/L/h.

An as yet unidentiﬁed PLP-containing aminotransferase is thought to catalyze the formation of a-aminoadipate from a-ketoadipate in the L-lysine biosynthetic pathway that could be the yeast Aro8 gene product. A screen of several different amino acids and keto-acids showed that the enzyme uses L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, a-ketoadipate, and L-a-aminoadipate as substrates. The UV–visible spectrum of the aminotransferase exhibits maxima at 280 and 343 nm at pH 7.5. As the pH is decreased the peak at 343 nm (the unprotonated internal aldimine) disappears and two new peaks at 328 and 400 nm are observed representing the enolimine and ketoenamine tautomers of the protonated aldimine, respectively. Addition, at pH 7.1, of a-ketoadipate to free enzyme leads to disappearance of the absorbance at 343 nm and appearance of peaks at 328 and 424 nm. The V/Et and V/Ka-ketoadipateEt pH proﬁles are pH independent from pH 6.5 to 9.6, while the V/KL-tyrosine pH-rate proﬁle decreases below a single pKa of 7.0 ± 0.1. Data suggest the active enzyme form is with the internal aldimine unprotonated. We conclude the enzyme should be categorized as a a-aminoadipate aminotransferase.},

	abstract = {One of the most obvious phenotypes of a cell is its metabolic activity, which is defined by the fluxes in the metabolic network. Although experimental methods to determine intracellular fluxes are well established, only a limited number of fluxes can be resolved. Especially in eukaryotes such as yeast, compartmentalization and the existence of many parallel routes render exact flux analysis impossible using current methods. To gain more insight into the metabolic operation of S. cerevisiae we developed a new computational approach where we characterize the flux solution space by determining elementary flux modes (EFMs) that are subsequently classified as thermodynamically feasible or infeasible on the basis of experimental metabolome data. This allows us to provably rule out the contribution of certain EFMs to the in vivo flux distribution. From the 71 million EFMs in a medium size metabolic network of S. cerevisiae, we classified 54\% as thermodynamically feasible. By comparing the thermodynamically feasible and infeasible EFMs, we could identify reaction combinations that span the cytosol and mitochondrion and, as a system, cannot operate under the investigated glucose batch conditions. Besides conclusions on single reactions, we found that thermodynamic constraints prevent the import of redox cofactor equivalents into the mitochondrion due to limits on compartmental cofactor concentrations. Our novel approach of incorporating quantitative metabolite concentrations into the analysis of the space of all stoichiometrically feasible flux distributions allows generating new insights into the system-level operation of the intracellular fluxes without making assumptions on metabolic objectives of the cell.},

Although the concept of integral control has its origin in industrial processes, recent ﬁndings suggest that biological systems are also capable of showing integral control. We recently described a basic set of negative feedback structures (controller motifs) where robust homeostasis is achieved against diﬀerent but constant perturbations. As many perturbations in biology, such as infections, increase rapidly over time, we investigated how the diﬀerent controller motifs equipped with diﬀerent implementations of integral control perform in relation to rapidly changing perturbations, including exponential and hyperbolic changes. The ﬁndings show that the construction of an optimum biochemical controller design for time-dependent perturbations requires a certain match between the structure of the negative feedback loop, its signaling kinetics, and the kinetics of how integral control is implemented within the negative feedback loop.},

Of many biological systems, Escherichia coli metabolic pathways have been modeled extensively at the enzymatic and genetic levels, but existing models cannot accurately reproduce experimental behaviors in a batch culture, due to the inadequate estimation of a specific cell growth rate and a large number of unmeasured parameters.
Results:  In this study, we developed a detailed kinetic model for the central carbon metabolism of E. coli in a batch culture, which includes the glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway, anaplerotic pathway, glyoxylate shunt, oxidative phosphorylation, phosphotransferase system (Pts), nonPts and metabolic gene regulations by four protein transcription factors: cAMP receptor, catabolite repressor/activator, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex repressor and isocitrate lyase regulator. The kinetic parameters were estimated by a constrained optimization method on a supercomputer. The model estimated a specific growth rate based on reaction kinetics and accurately reproduced the dynamics of wild-type E. coli and multiple genetic mutants in a batch culture.
Conclusions:  This model overcame the intrinsic limitations of existing kinetic models in a batch culture, predicted the effects of multilayer regulations (allosteric effectors and gene expression) on central carbon metabolism and proposed rationally designed fast-growing cells based on understandings of molecular processes.},

How is balanced utilization achieved, despite ﬂuctuations in the concentrations of the enzymes that make up the regulatory circuitry? Here we address this question by studying the nitrogen system of E. coli. A mechanism based on the avidity of a bifunctional enzyme, adenylyltransferase (AT/AR), to its multimeric substrate, glutamine synthetase, is proposed to maintain a robust ratio between two key metabolites, glutamine and a-ketoglutarate. This ratio is predicted to be insensitive to variations in protein levels of the core circuit and to the rate of nitrogen utilization. We ﬁnd using mass spectrometry that the metabolite ratio is robust to variations in protein levels and that this robustness depends on the bifunctional enzyme. Moreover, robustness carries through to the bacteria growth rate. Interrupting avidity by adding a monofunctional AT/AR mutant to the native system abolishes robustness, as predicted by the proposed mechanism.},

These network models provide deep insights into the organization, dynamics, and function of biochemical systems: for example, by revealing genetic control pathways involved in disease. However, the traditional representation of biochemical networks as binary interaction graphs fails to accurately represent an important dynamical feature of these multivariate systems: some pathways propagate control signals much more effectively than do others. Such heterogeneity of interactions reflects canalization—the system is robust to dynamical interventions in redundant pathways but responsive to interventions in effective pathways. Here, we introduce the effective graph, a weighted graph that captures the nonlinear logical redundancy present in biochemical network regulation, signaling, and control. Using 78 experimentally validated models derived from systems biology, we demonstrate that 1) redundant pathways are prevalent in biological models of biochemical regulation, 2) the effective graph provides a probabilistic but precise characterization of multivariate dynamics in a causal graph form, and 3) the effective graph provides an accurate explanation of how dynamical perturbation and control signals, such as those induced by cancer drug therapies, propagate in biochemical pathways. Overall, our results indicate that the effective graph provides an enriched description of the structure and dynamics of networked multivariate causal interactions. We demonstrate that it improves explainability, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems in general and biochemical regulation in particular.},

Two E. coli knockout strains were constructed: one that blocked the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (gnd KO) and one that decoupled the TCA cycle from electron transport (sdhCDAB KO). Despite major perturbations in central metabolism, minimal growth rate changes were found in the two knockout strains. More surprisingly, many similarities were found in their initial transcriptomic states that could be traced to similarly perturbed metabolites despite the differences in the network location of the gene perturbations and concomitant re-routing of pathway ﬂuxes around these perturbations. However, following ALE, distinct metabolomic and transcriptomic states were realized. These included divergent ﬂux and gene expression proﬁles in the gnd and sdhCDAB KOs to overcome imbalances in NADPH production and nitrogen/sulfur assimilation, respectively, that were not obvious limitations of growth in the unevolved knockouts. Therefore, this work demonstrates that ALE provides a productive approach to reveal novel insights of gene function at a systems level that cannot be found by observing the fresh knockout alone.},

To perform kinetic studies, CdRP was chemically synthesized, puriﬁed, and spectroscopically and spectrometrically characterized.

The activation energy was calculated, and solvent isotope effects and proton inventory studies were performed. pH-rate proﬁles were carried out to probe for acid/base catalysis, showing that a deprotonated residue is necessary for CdRP binding and conversion to IGP.

Control engineers, who must design similar regulatory systems, have developed a number of general principles that govern feedback regulation. These lead to constraints which impose trade-offs that arise when developing controllers to minimize the effect of external disturbances on systems. Here, we review some of these trade-offs, particularly Bode’s integral formula. We also highlight its connection to information theory, by showing that the constraints in sensitivity minimization can be cast as limitations on the information transmission through a system, and these have their root in causality. Finally, we look at how these constraints arise in two biological systems: glycolytic oscillations and the energy cost of perfect adaptation in a bacterial chemotactic pathway.},

	abstract = {A key issue in both molecular and evolutionary biology has been to define the roles of genes and phenotypes in the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes. The dominant view has been that an organism’s metabolic adaptations are driven by gene expression and that gene mutations, independent of the starting phenotype, are responsible for the evolution of new metabolic phenotypes. We propose an alternate hypothesis, in which the phenotype and genotype together determine metabolic adaptation both in the lifetime of the organism and in the evolutionary selection of adaptive metabolic traits. We tested this hypothesis by flux-balance and metabolic-control analysis of the relative roles of the starting phenotype and gene expression in regulating the metabolic adaptations during the Crabtree effect in yeast, when they are switched from a low- to high-glucose environment. Critical for successful short-term adaptation was the ability of the glycogen/trehalose shunt to balance the glycolytic pathway. The role of later gene expression of new isoforms of glycolytic enzymes, rather than flux control, was to provide additional homeostatic mechanisms allowing an increase in the amount and efficiency of adenosine triphosphate and product formation while maintaining glycolytic balance. We further showed that homeostatic mechanisms, by allowing increased phenotypic plasticity, could have played an important role in guiding the evolution of the Crabtree effect. Although our findings are specific to Crabtree yeast, they are likely to be broadly found because of the well-recognized similarities in glucose metabolism across kingdoms and phyla from yeast to humans.},

	abstract = {The uptake and catabolism of galactose by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is much lower than for glucose and fructose, and in applications of this yeast for utilization of complex substrates that contain galactose, for example, lignocellulose and rafﬁnose, this causes prolonged fermentations. Galactose is metabolized via the Leloir pathway, and besides the industrial interest in improving the ﬂux through this pathway it is also of medical relevance to study the Leloir pathway. Thus, genetic disorders in the genes encoding galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase or galactokinase result in galactose toxicity both in patients with galactosemia and in yeast. In order to elucidate galactose related toxicity, which may explain the low uptake and catabolic rates of S. cerevisiae, we have studied the physiological characteristics and intracellular metabolite proﬁles of recombinant S. cerevisiae strains with improved or impaired growth on galactose. Aerobic batch cultivations on galactose of strains with different combinations of overexpression of the genes GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, and GAL10, which encode proteins that together convert extracellular galactose into glucose-1-phosphate, revealed a decrease in the maximum speciﬁc growth rate when compared to the reference strain. The hypothesized toxic intermediate galactose-1-phosphate cannot be the sole cause of galactose related toxicity, but indications were found that galactose-1-phosphate might cause a negative effect through inhibition of phosphoglucomutase. Furthermore, we show that galactitol is formed in S. cerevisiae, and that the combination of elevated intracellular galactitol concentration, and the ratio between galactose-1-phosphate concentration and phosphoglucomutase activity seems to be important for galactose related toxicity causing decreased growth rates.},

              Escherichia coli
              into different metabolic processes in response to changing
              μ

We detected slowly growing cells investing more proteome resources in energy generation and carbohydrate transport and metabolism whereas for achieving faster growth cells needed to devote most resources to translation and processes closely related to the protein synthesis pipeline. Furthermore, down-regulation of energy generation and carbohydrate metabolism proteins with faster growth displayed very similar expression dynamics with the global transcriptional regulator CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein), pointing to a dominant protein resource allocating role of this protein. Our data also suggest that acetate overflow may be the result of global proteome resource optimisation as cells saved proteome resources by switching from fully respiratory to respiro-fermentative growth. The presented results give a quantitative overview of how

Results:  Using metabolic engineering and a systems biology approach, we developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce 242 mg/L of p-coumaric acid from xylose. The same strain produced only 5.35 mg/L when cultivated with glucose as carbon source. To characterise this platform strain further, transcriptomic analysis was performed, comparing this strain’s growth on xylose and glucose, revealing a strong up-regulation of the glyoxylate pathway alongside increased cell wall biosynthesis and unexpectedly a decrease in aromatic amino acid gene expression when xylose was used as carbon source.
Conclusions:  The resulting S. cerevisiae strain represents a promising platform host for future production of p-coumaric using xylose as a carbon source.},

	abstract = {Adipic acid, a nylon-6,6 precursor, has recently gained popularity in synthetic biology. Here, 16 diﬀerent production routes to adipic acid were evaluated using a novel tool for network-embedded thermodynamic analysis of elementary ﬂux modes. The tool distinguishes between thermodynamically feasible and infeasible modes under determined metabolite concentrations, allowing the thermodynamic feasibility of theoretical yields to be assessed. Further, patterns that always caused infeasible ﬂux distributions were identiﬁed, which will aid the development of tailored strain design. A review of cellular eﬄux mechanisms revealed that signiﬁcant accumulation of extracellular product is only possible if coupled with ATP hydrolysis. A stoichiometric analysis demonstrated that the maximum theoretical product carbon yield heavily depends on the metabolic route, ranging from 32 to 99\% on glucose and/or palmitate in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic models. Equally important, metabolite concentrations appeared to be thermodynamically restricted in several pathways. Consequently, the number of thermodynamically feasible ﬂux distributions was reduced, in some cases even rendering whole pathways infeasible, highlighting the importance of pathway choice. Only routes based on the shikimate pathway were thermodynamically favorable over a large concentration and pH range. The low pH capability of S. cerevisiae shifted the thermodynamic equilibrium of some pathways toward product formation. One identiﬁed infeasible-pattern revealed that the reversibility of the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase contradicted the current state of knowledge, which imposes a major restriction on the metabolism of S. cerevisiae. Finally, the evaluation of industrially relevant constraints revealed that two shikimate pathway-based routes in E. coli were the most robust.},

With the growing availability of omics data and of methodologies capable to integrate the available data into models, mathematical modeling and computational analysis are becoming important in designing recombinant cellular organisms and optimizing cell performance with respect to desired criteria. In this contribution, we used the computational framework ORACLE (Optimization and Risk Analysis of Complex Living Entities) to analyze the physiology of recombinant Escherichia coli producing 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and to identify potential strategies for improved production of BDO. The framework allowed us to integrate data across multiple levels and to construct a population of large-scale kinetic models despite the lack of available information about kinetic properties of every enzyme in the metabolic pathways. We analyzed these models and we found that the enzymes that primarily control the ﬂuxes leading to BDO production are part of central glycolysis, the lower branch of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the novel BDO production route. Interestingly, among the enzymes between the glucose uptake and the BDO pathway, the enzymes belonging to the lower branch of TCA cycle have been identiﬁed as the most important for improving BDO production and yield. We also quantiﬁed the effects of changes of the target enzymes on other intracellular states like energy charge, cofactor levels, redox state, cellular growth, and byproduct formation. Independent earlier experiments on this strain conﬁrmed that the computationally obtained conclusions are consistent with the experimentally tested designs, and the ﬁndings of the present studies can provide guidance for future work on strain improvement. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of ORACLE for the accelerated design of microbial cell factories.},

Many biological regulatory networks are known to act homeostatically, with examples including thermal adaptation, osmoregulation, and chemotaxis. Understanding the network topologies (sets of regulatory interactions) and biological parameter regimes that can yield homeostasis in a biological system is of interest both for the study of natural biological system, and in the context of designing new biological control schemes for use in synthetic biology. Here, we examine the mathematical properties of a function that maps a biological system's inputs to its outputs, we have formulated a novel criterion (the “cofactor condition”) that compactly describes the conditions for homeostasis. We further analyze the problem of robust homeostasis, wherein the system is required to maintain homeostatic behavior when its parameter values are slightly altered. We use the cofactor condition to examine previously reported examples of robust homeostasis, showing that it is a useful way to unify a number of seemingly different analyses into a single framework. Based on the observation that all previous robustly homeostatic examples fall into one of three classes, we propose a “strong cofactor condition” and use it to provide an algorithm for designing new robustly homeostatic biological networks, giving both their topologies and constraints on their parameter values. Applying the design algorithm to a three-node biological network, we construct several robustly homeostatic genetic networks, uncovering network topologies not previously identiﬁed as candidates for exhibiting robust homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, learning from these data to predict how a cell will respond to genetic changes, a key need for engineering, remains challenging. A promising technique for leveraging omics measurements in metabolic modeling involves the construction of kinetic descriptions of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these models from biological data can be computationally difficult, since methods must also quantify the uncertainty in model parameters resulting from the observed data. While the field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for efficiently estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty, such techniques are poorly suited to traditional kinetic models due to their complex rate laws and resulting nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of problem scales, including nearly genome-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and in developing new, efficient strain designs.},

            Synthetic biology allows us to bioengineer cells to synthesize novel valuable molecules such as renewable biofuels or anticancer drugs. However, traditional synthetic biology approaches involve ad-hoc engineering practices, which lead to long development times. Here, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide synthetic biology in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels. We demonstrate the capabilities of ART on simulated data sets, as well as experimental data from real metabolic engineering projects producing renewable biofuels, hoppy flavored beer without hops, fatty acids, and tryptophan. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach, and the practical consequences of the underlying assumptions failing.},

Replicate adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) of PTS and detailed omics data sets collected revealed that the PTS bridged the gap between respiration and fermentation, leading to distinct high fermentative and high respiratory rate phenotypes. It was also found that while all strains retained high levels of aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthetic precursors, only one replicate from the high glycolytic clade retained high levels of intracellular AAAs. The fast growth and high AAA precursor phenotypes could provide a starting host for cell factories targeting the overproduction aromatic metabolites.},

First we introduced the biosynthetic pathway, consisting of tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, 4-coumaryl-CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana and resveratrol synthase from Vitis vinifera, and obtained 2.73 70.05 mg LÀ1 resveratrol from glucose. Then we over-expressed feedback-insensitive alleles of ARO4 encoding 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate and ARO7 encoding chorismate mutase, resulting in production of 4.85 70.31 mg LÀ1 resveratrol from glucose as the sole carbon source. Next we improved the supply of the precursor malonyl-CoA by over-expressing a post-translational deregulated version of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase encoding gene ACC1; this strategy further increased resveratrol production to 6.39 70.03 mg LÀ1. Subsequently, we improved the strain by performing multiple-integration of pathway genes resulting in resveratrol production of 235.57 77.00 mg LÀ1. Finally, fed-batch fermentation of the ﬁnal strain with glucose or ethanol as carbon source resulted in a resveratrol titer of 415.65 and 531.41 mg LÀ1, respectively.},

Advances in DNA assembly and gene insulation facilitate this approach by accelerating multi-gene pathway construction and the statistical interpretation of screening data. This is applied to a 6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA) pathway in Escherichia coli consisting of six heterologous enzymes. A 32member fraction factorial library is designed that simultaneously perturbs expression and media composition. This is compared to a 64-member full factorial library just varying expression (0.64 Mb of DNA assembly). Statistical analysis of the screening data from these libraries leads to different predictions as to whether the expression of enzymes needs to increase or decrease. Therefore, if genotype and media were varied separately this would lead to a suboptimal combination. This is applied to the design of a strain and media composition that increases 6ACA from 9 to 48 mg/l in a single optimization step.

            Large-scale data acquisition and analysis are often required in the successful implementation of the design, build, test, and learn (DBTL) cycle in biosystems design. However, it has long been hindered by experimental cost, variability, biases, and missed insights from traditional analysis methods. Here, we report the application of an integrated robotic system coupled with machine learning algorithms to fully automate the DBTL process for biosystems design. As proof of concept, we have demonstrated its capacity by optimizing the lycopene biosynthetic pathway. This fully-automated robotic platform, BioAutomata, evaluates less than 1\% of possible variants while outperforming random screening by 77\%. A paired predictive model and Bayesian algorithm select experiments which are performed by Illinois Biological Foundry for Advanced Biomanufacturing (iBioFAB). BioAutomata excels with black-box optimization problems, where experiments are expensive and noisy and the success of the experiment is not dependent on extensive prior knowledge of biological mechanisms.},

Utilising characterised biological parts aids in the design and redesign of genetic pathways. The characterisation information held on datasheets can be used to determine whether a biological part meets the design requirements. To manage the design of genetic pathways, researchers have turned to modelling-based computer aided design software tools.
Result: An automated workflow has been developed for the design and build of heterologous metabolic pathways. In addition, to demonstrate the powers of electronic datasheets we have developed software which can transfer part information from a datasheet to the Design of Experiment software JMP. To this end we were able to use Design of Experiment software to rationally design and test randomised samples from the design space of a lycopene pathway in E. coli. This pathway was optimised by individually modulating the promoter strength, RBS strength, and gene order targets.
Conclusion: The use of standardised and characterised biological parts will empower a design-oriented synthetic biology for the forward engineering of heterologous expression systems. A Design of Experiment approach streamlines the design-build-test cycle to achieve optimised solutions in biodesign. Developed automated workflows provide effective transfer of information between characterised information (in the form of datasheets) and DoE software.},

	volume = {68},
	abstract = {High-cell-density fed-batch processes for bakers’ yeast production will involve a low-average-specific growth rate due to the limited oxygen-transfer capacity of industrial bioreactors. The relationship between specific growth rate and fermentative capacity was investigated in aerobic, sucrose-limited fed-batch cultures of an industrial bakers’ yeast strain. Using a defined mineral medium, biomass concentrations of 130 g dry weight/L were reproducibly attained. After an initial exponentialfeed phase (µ = 0.18 h−1), oxygen-transfer limitation necessitated a gradual decrease of the specific growth rate to ca. 0.01 h−1. Throughout fed-batch cultivation, sugar metabolism was fully respiratory, with a biomass yield of 0.5 g biomass/g sucrose−1. Fermentative capacity (assayed off-line as ethanol production rate under anaerobic conditions with excess glucose) showed a strong positive correlation with specific growth rate. The fermentative capacity observed at the end of the process (µ = 0.01 h−1) was only half that observed during the exponential-feed phase (µ = 0.18 h−1). During fed-batch cultivation, activities of glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in cell extracts did not exhibit marked changes. This suggests that changes of fermentative capacity during fed-batch cultivation were not primarily caused by regulation of the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {An increasing number of industrial bioprocesses capitalize on living cells by using them as cell factories that convert sugars into chemicals. These processes range from the production of bulk chemicals in yeasts and bacteria to the synthesis of therapeutic proteins in mammalian cell lines. One of the tools in the continuous search for improved performance of such production systems is the development and application of mathematical models. To be of value for industrial biotechnology, mathematical models should be able to assist in the rational design of cell factory properties or in the production processes in which they are utilized. Kinetic models are particularly suitable towards this end because they are capable of representing the complex biochemistry of cells in a more complete way compared to most other types of models. They can, at least in principle, be used to in detail understand, predict, and evaluate the effects of adding, removing, or modifying molecular components of a cell factory and for supporting the design of the bioreactor or fermentation process. However, several challenges still remain before kinetic modeling will reach the degree of maturity required for routine application in industry. Here we review the current status of kinetic cell factory modeling. Emphasis is on modeling methodology concepts, including model network structure, kinetic rate expressions, parameter estimation, optimization methods, identiﬁability analysis, model reduction, and model validation, but several applications of kinetic models for the improvement of cell factories are also discussed.},

Starting from an approximate mathematical model, we employ a ‘‘cycle of knowledge’’ strategy, identifying the steps with most control over ﬂux. Kinetic parameters of the individual isoenzymes within these steps are measured experimentally under a standardised set of conditions. Experimental strategies are applied to establish a set of in vivo concentrations for isoenzymes and metabolites. The data are integrated into a mathematical model that is used to predict a new set of metabolite concentrations and reevaluate the control properties of the system. This bottom-up modelling study reveals that control over the metabolic network most directly involved in yeast glycolysis is more widely distributed than previously thought.},

Fluxomics integrates in vivo measurements of metabolic ﬂuxes with stoichiometric network models to allow the determination of absolute ﬂux through large networks of the central carbon metabolism. There are many approaches to implement ﬂuxomics including ﬂux balance analysis (FBA), 13C ﬂuxomics and 13C-constrained FBA as well as many experimental settings for ﬂux measurement including dynamic, stationary and semi-stationary. Here we outline the principles of the different approaches and their relative advantages. We demonstrate the unique contribution of ﬂux analysis for phenotype elucidation using a thoroughly studied metabolic reaction as a case study, the microbial aerobic/anaerobic shift, highlighting the importance of ﬂux analysis as a single layer of data as well as interlaced in multi-omics studies.},

Advances in computational power, gene annotation coverage, and formalism standardization have led to significant progress over the past few years. However, careful interpretation of model predictions, limited metabolic flux datasets, and assessment of parameter sensitivity remain as challenges. In this review we highlight fundamental considerations which influence model quality and prediction, advances in methodologies, and success stories of deploying kinetic models to guide metabolic engineering.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors investigated how the glycolytic ﬂux was regulated in time upon nitrogen starvation of cells with different growth histories. We have compared cells grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures under respiratory conditions (low dilution rate of 0.1/h) to cells grown under respirofermentative conditions (high dilution rate of 0.35/h). The fermentative capacity was lower in cells grown under respiratory conditions than in cells grown under respirofermentative conditions, yet more resilient to prolonged nitrogen starvation. The time proﬁles revealed that the fermentative capacity even increased in cells grown under respiratory conditions during the ﬁrst hours of nitrogen starvation. In cells grown under respirofermentative conditions the fermentative capacity decreased from the onset of nitrogen starvation. We have applied timedependent Regulation Analysis to follow the fermentative capacity during nitrogen starvation. In both experiments, diverse categories of regulation were found. However, in the cells grown under respiratory conditions regulation was predominantly metabolic, whereas in the cells grown under respirofermentative conditions hierarchical regulation was dominant. To study the metabolic regulation, concentrations of intracellular metabolites, including allosteric regulators, were measured. The obtained results can explain some aspects of the metabolic regulation, but not all.},

	abstract = {Toxicity from the external presence or internal production of compounds can reduce the growth and viability of microbial cell factories and compromise productivity. Aromatic compounds are generally toxic for microorganisms, which makes their production in microbial hosts challenging. Here we use adaptive laboratory evolution to generate
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              mutants tolerant to two aromatic acids, coumaric acid and ferulic acid. The evolution experiments were performed at low pH (3.5) to reproduce conditions typical of industrial processes. Mutant strains tolerant to levels of aromatic acids near the solubility limit were then analyzed by whole genome sequencing, which revealed prevalent point mutations in a transcriptional activator (Aro80) that is responsible for regulating the use of aromatic amino acids as the nitrogen source. Among the genes regulated by Aro80,
              ESBP6
              was found to be responsible for increasing tolerance to aromatic acids by exporting them out of the cell. Further examination of the native function of Esbp6 revealed that this transporter can excrete fusel acids (byproducts of aromatic amino acid catabolism) and this role is shared with at least one additional transporter native to
              S. cerevisiae
              (Pdr12). Besides conferring tolerance to aromatic acids,
              ESBP6
              overexpression was also shown to significantly improve the secretion in coumaric acid production strains. Overall, we showed that regulating the activity of transporters is a major mechanism to improve tolerance to aromatic acids. These findings can be used to modulate the intracellular concentration of aromatic compounds to optimize the excretion of such products while keeping precursor molecules inside the cell.},
